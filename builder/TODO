3:45 C9 LOD BUG IS CONFIRMED
found the bug
    it occurs when a game is shared between two players. because the gameId already exists in the DB after you load it for the first player, it doesn't store the game again for the second player. however, the game is only associated with the first player, so the second player doesn't get the game on his page

    solution: store multiple summoners per game, and use $elemMatch to query

    test if fixerino workerino using RoA
