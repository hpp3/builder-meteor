work on:

features:
style text
custom 404 handler
figure out what the deal with routes is
    modify url (client side routing????)
    click the match for details!
build nerd math
    determine when champions "base"
        time is in milliseconds (assume all shop events within 10 seconds are a base?)
    determine how many stats/what spells champions have during baseEvents
        for tear, must estimate based off game time and spellcast info
        for mejai/occult, can compute
    foreach item (or item combos?) in items (or restricted subset of items): 
        foreach enemy in enemy_team + [baron, dragon]:
            calculate dps, and time needed to kill enemy, or print 'one shottable'
            compute how much damage you take from  enemy (burst and dps)
        do some kind of weighting?
        implement item passives
            easy:
                -lw/void
                -iedge
                -dcap
                -frozen heart
                -randuin
                -haunting guise
            hard:
                -liandry
                -botrk
                -luden
                -spellblade
    determine which items counter which champions?
        e.g. 65% win rate vs zed with zhonya or qss
    compute 'build mistakes' and enumerate

translate the ALL_CAPS_5x5 to real strings
make match loading dynamic (load cached results first then do API call)
mobile support
    fix huge match-header issue
    consider responsive design
    fix default scaling

bugtracker:
"throbber" is shitty
why is the match-header so huge on mobile?
loading same summoner causes permanent "loading" message (load hpp3, then click find again)

changelog:
client side routing, rendering
route for player lookup
search uses route
